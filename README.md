# Concern Slicer

This application aims at measuring separation of concerns in texts, typically programs.
The first feature consists in colorizing texts using one color per concern.
Concerns are specified by a name, a color, a list of tokens.
The tokens are given in a file, usually one per line but layout is ignored.
